Suburban Farm

A web app for suburban farmers to connect with urban consumers that want to reduce their food waste and support their local community.

We created this web app with the intention of supporting the local farmers and help consumers reduce the amount of food they waste every day by providing them with only the freshest products straight to their doors! Through the app, both consumers and producers will be able to have a positive impact on their local community.
